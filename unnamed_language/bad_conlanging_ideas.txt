'Before', 'In front of', 'behind', 'because', and stuff like that are prefixes
'Within', 'while', 'Inside', 'of', 'is contained in' are infixes
'on', 'after', 'why', 'when', 'how', 'what', 'who', 'whom' are suffixes of the thing you're
eg. I cried when I was cutting onions.
You put a suffix after 'I was cutting onions'
